# Spring Security Project - Database Authentication and Authorization

This project demonstrates the implementation of authentication and authorization using Spring Security with a database-backed approach. User credentials are securely stored in the database with encrypted passwords.

## Project Structure
### 1. Security Configuration - SecurityConfig.java

This file contains the main configuration for Spring Security. It includes settings for authentication, authorization, and encryption of passwords. Here's a brief overview of the key configurations:

- @EnableWebSecurity: Enables Spring Security for the project.
- 
- configure(HttpSecurity http): Configures security settings such as URL access permissions, login/logout behavior, and more.
- 
- configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures the authentication provider. In this project, a custom UserDetailsService (CustomUserDetailsService) is used to load user details from the database.

### 2. Custom User Model - CustomUser.java

This file defines a custom user model (CustomUser) representing users in the system. It extends the User class provided by Spring Security. The CustomUser class includes additional fields or methods required for your application. For example, you may include fields like firstName, lastName, etc.

### 3. Custom UserDetailsService - CustomUserDetailsService.java

This class implements the UserDetailsService interface, which is used by Spring Security to load user details during authentication. The loadUserByUsername method fetches user details from the database based on the username. The retrieved user details are then used for authentication.

### 4. Database Configuration - application.properties

In the application.properties file, configure the database connection properties such as URL, username, password, and the driver class. This ensures that Spring Security can interact with the database to authenticate and authorize users.

## properties file

### Database Configuration

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

## Usage

1- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-security-database.git

2- Configure your database properties in the application.properties file.

3- Run the application.

4- Access the application at http://localhost:8080.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholders such as your_database, your_username, and your_password with your actual database details.

- Customize the CustomUser class based on your application requirements.

- Update the security rules in SecurityConfig.java as needed for your project.
